# üè† realEstateAI

An end-to-end **machine learning application** that predicts property prices, analyzes market trends, provides insights, and recommends properties based on user preferences.  

This project demonstrates the complete data science workflow ‚Äî from **manual data collection to model training, analytics, and visualization** ‚Äî showcasing strong hands-on skills in **core machine learning and data analytics**.

---

## Price Prediction Module
- Predicts property prices using **XGBoost Regression**.
- Considers key features like area, sector, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and property type.
- Handles complex, non-linear relationships with high accuracy.

---

## Analytics Module
- Visualizes property price trends across different sectors and areas.
- Analyzes how prices vary with different property features.
- Helps users understand broader **market dynamics**.

---

## Insights Module
- Provides **feature-wise insights**, such as how much price increases with an additional bedroom or larger area.
- Offers **explainability** and **interpretability** for model predictions.

---

## Recommender System
- Suggests similar or nearby properties based on **user preferences**.
- Uses similarity-based logic to recommend **top listings** with best-value pricing.

---

##  Workflow Overview

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Manually scraped and compiled property data from multiple real estate listings to ensure authenticity and diversity.  
   - The dataset was created entirely from scratch, reflecting genuine market conditions.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and engineered new features to enhance model accuracy.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Trained and fine-tuned an **XGBoost Regressor** with hyperparameter optimization to achieve strong predictive performance.

4. **Analysis & Visualization**  
   - Built rich analytics dashboards to interpret property price variations across different regions and features.

5. **Recommender System**  
   - Designed a similarity-based recommendation engine suggesting best-value properties based on preferences and location proximity.

6. **Interface Integration**  
   - Integrated all modules using **Streamlit**, creating a unified interactive experience for users.

7. **Deployment**  
   - Deployed on **AWS Cloud** for high availability, scalability, and seamless accessibility.
